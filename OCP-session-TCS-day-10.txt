LDAPSYNC - showing errors - I will fix and update to GitHub - same link (LdapSync)

 - Create a cronJobs - Main purpose of cronjob here is to synchronization (OCP cluster Sync with LDAP).
 - Use the oc policy (oc adm policy) to list user and groups - RBAC policies implements.
 
 Step 1) Login to OCP cluster using "cluster-admin" - admin/user1 
 
 Step 2) Download the certificate from LDAP server (ca for LDAP). - (Trusted sync between OCP and LDAP).
 
 Step 3) ldap-sync.yml (Update the input)
       bindPassword: password123 (LDAP admin password).
	   update ca: certificate-ca.crt

 Step 4) oc adm group sync --sync-config  ldap-sync.yml
 
      Note: Sync without any action.
 
 Step 5) oc new-project "name of the project" 
         oc new-project auth-padapsync 
		 
		 oc create -f rbac.yml 
		 
 Step 6) Cronjobs file need to execute.
         Must be having "configmap and secret".

 Adding Compute nodes to the OCP cluster.
 
 - Node Scaling- 
 
 - Build OCP cluster (Using IPI or UPI methods)
   - bootstrap.ign 
   - master.ign 
   - worker.ign 
   
  - Machine API automatically perform scalling operations (w.r.t support cloud provides).
  
  In UPI, you must manually provision new instance. (It's depends on business strategy and IT related process).
  Basic steps for the same.
  
  1) Update the compute node ignition file with an updated TLS certificate. 
      FIle - worker.ign
  2) Install RHEL CoreOS from ISO or using PXE (Preboot eXcution Environment - "PXE" boot).
  3) Add the new instance to the ingress load balancer.
  4) Approve Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) to allow the compuate node to join OCP cluster.
